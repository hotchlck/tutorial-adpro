## Reflection 1
In developing my project, I implemented key coding standards to enhance readability, maintainability, and security:

1. **Clear Naming:** Variables and functions have clear, descriptive names, following camelCase in Java. This minimizes the need for comments by making the code self-explanatory.

2. **Effective Functions:** Functions are concise and focused on a single responsibility, reducing repetition and ensuring clarity. They avoid side effects and do not return null.

3. **Minimal Comments:** Comments are only added where necessary, such as explaining data formats or complex logic, instead of describing what the code does.

4. **Structured Code:** The code is organized using objects, repositories, services, and implementations for clear structure and separation of concerns.

5. **Feature Branch Workflow:** Development follows a "feature branch workflow," enhancing code safety by isolating changes until tested and reviewed.

For improvement, I identified the need for better secure coding practices:

1. **Enhanced Input Validation:** Beyond preventing runtime errors, more specific input validation and authentication/authorization mechanisms are necessary to protect against security threats.

2. **Robust Error Handling:** Anticipating potential errors and exceptions ensures smooth operation under various conditions.

Testing has increased confidence in the program's correctness. Effective testing covers expected behavior, error conditions, and edge cases, aiming for about 80% code coverage. Meaningful tests are essential for true robustness.

In summary, the focus has been on writing clear, maintainable, and secure code by following best practices and continuously improving. The goal is to develop functional, resilient, and manageable software.
